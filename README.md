# Compositional Game Theory for Neural Networks

This repository includes:

- cgtnnlib, a library for performing my particular research on the application
  of the compositional game theory [1] to neural network architecture design
  and analysis
- notebooks for running experiments

## How to run

1. Create a virtual environment
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open a notebook `*.ipynb` file with any .ipynb reader available to you
   and run
