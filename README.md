# Compositional Game Theory for Neural Networks

This repository explores the application of compositional game
theory, as introduced in the paper *Compositional Game Theory* [1] to
the analysis and enhancement of neural networks. We represent neural
network components as players in open games, aiming to leverage
game-theoretic tools for improved training and understanding.

It includes:

- cgtnnlib, a library for performing my research
- notebooks for running experiments

## How to run

1. Create a virtual environment
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open a notebook `*.ipynb` file with any .ipynb reader available to you
   and run
